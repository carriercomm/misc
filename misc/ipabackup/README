ipabackup schedules backups of the databse for IPA, both PKI and the main
directory server

= Install =

== Create a dedicated backup user ==
Run prepare-backupuser.sh, you need you directory manager password handy.

What this does is create a user, cn=backupuser,cn=config and create a access
rule to allow the user to create a backup task, cn=backup,cn=tasks,cn=config.


== ipabackup.sh ==
You should open the script and change the following:
 * BACKUP_DAYS=
 * BACKUPUSER_PW=
 * DIRSRV_NAME=

Then copy the script to somewhere sane, eg /usr/local/bin/ipabackup.sh

== Periodic runs ==
This is only tested on Fedora/RHEL
{{{
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ipabackup.sh /etc/cron.daily/ipabackup.sh
}}}

== Logrotate ==
{{{
cp ipabackup-logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/ipabackup
}}}


= Test =
* Run /usr/local/bin/ipabackup.sh
* Check /var/log/ipabackup.log
