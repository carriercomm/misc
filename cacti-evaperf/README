Additionally data queries allow for dynamic creation of graph per vdisk.

== Installation ==
These templates require '''cacti version 0.8.7e''' or later. Templates where created and tested on RHEL/Centos 5.x
 # wget http://pall.sigurdsson.is/filez/cacti-evaperf.tar.gz
 # tar -zxvf cacti-evaperf.tar.gz
 # mv cacti-evaperf/scripts/query_wmi.py ~cacti/scripts
 # mv cacti-evaperf/script_queries/* ~cacti/resource/script_queries
 # mv cacti-evaperf/scripts/wmic /usr/local/bin


Create a password file for WMI:
 # echo "username=administrator" > /etc/cacti/HOSTNAME.pw
 # echo "password=MYPASSWORD" >> /etc/cacti/HOSTNAME.pw
 # echo "domain=mydomain" >> /etc/cacti/HOSTNAME.pw

Note 1: here HOSTNAME represent the name of your command-view server as it appears in cacti. So if you add your server as eva-appliance.example.com in cacti then the password file is named /etc/cacti/eva-appliance.example.com.pw

Note 2: if the account you use to log into the command view server is a local account (i.e. not a domain account) then feel free to skip the last (domain=) line in the example above.

Both apache and user running the cacti poller need write access to the following directories:
 # /var/tmp/cacti/ # Temporary cache for wmi
 # /var/log/cacti/ # query_wmi log for debugging purposes
 # /etc/cacti/HOSTNAME.pw # This file includes password used to access commandview server

Finally log into the cacti web interface and do the following:
 * Import template: cacti_host_template_eva_commandview.xml
 * Add Device: Add your commandview server, remember to add the appropriate host template
 * Create graphs for this host
